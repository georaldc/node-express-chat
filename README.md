Node.js Chat Server using Express
=========================

Chat server built using the express framework.

Description
-----------

Run server (don't forget to install dependencies using "npm install") then connect to it with a browser using the port 8000 (eg. http://localhost:8000). Other devices like mobile phones and their browsers may also connect as long as they are connected to the same network (http://server-ip:8000).

Issues

- On some clients like android mobile browsers, the disconnect event may sometimes not get triggered right away.
